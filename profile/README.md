## Reliability and Quality of Service Evaluation Methods for Rural Highways

Rural highways account for a very significant portion of the national highway system and serve many vital mobility purposes. Rural highways, which often span long distances, may consist of segments with a variety of cross-section elements (two-lane highway, multilane highway, passing lane sections) as well as intersections with different traffic controls (signal control, stop control, roundabouts with yield control).  

The Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), the standard reference for traffic analysis methodologies, contains analysis methods for all of the individual segments or intersections that may comprise a rural highway; however, it does not include a method, or guidance, for connecting the individual roadway segments into a connected, cohesive, facility-level analysis.  

This project resulted in the development of reliability and level of service analysis methodologies for rural highway facilities, consistent with existing HCM methods. These analysis methods are documented in the primary product of this project, a user guidebook. The guidebook is intended to assist transportation agencies charged with monitoring, maintaining, and improving rural highways of regional or statewide importance. More specifically, it is intended to assist with the evaluation of rural highways in three areas:

* Motorized vehicle traffic operations per HCM analysis methods,
* Motorized vehicle traffic operations per probe vehicle data analysis methods, and
* Overview of alternative analysis methods, to the HCM, for bicycles and recommendations for future bicycle operations research needs.  

The guidebook is organized into three main parts. The first part is focused on analysis methodology descriptions. The second part is focused on case studies using real-world routes to demonstrate the analysis methodologies in the Guidebook. The third part provides an overview of the component HCM analysis methodologies that are incorporated in the rural highway analysis methodology for automobiles.  

The guidebook has been implemented in HyperText Markup Language (HTML). This electronic format offers advantages over a printed format (e.g., search capabilities, ability to quickly move from location to another with hyperlinks), and furthermore, the HTML implementation provides advantages over a PDF electronic format. For example, the HTML format is not constrained to a linear presentation of the material, nor is it restricted to a conventional printed page size.
